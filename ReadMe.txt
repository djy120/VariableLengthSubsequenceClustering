Observing that most time series are consisted of various patterns with different unknown lengths, we propose an optimization framework to adaptively estimate the lengths and
representations for different patterns.

To run our codes and show the results on variable-length subsequence clustering in time series, just run "demo.m"

In demo.m£¬the inputs and outputs are listed and explained below:

	inputs: the input time series and the model parameter settings

		X     ---- the input time series;

		model ---- the model settings of variable-length subsequence clustering

		    model.k        --- the cluster number

		    model.minLen   --- the minimal subsequence length

		    model.maxLen   --- the maximal subsequence length

		    model.lenArray --- the length array in cluster initialization, default value is [model.minLen:model.maxLen], you can set other values for speeding-up


	outputs: the resulted subsequence segmentation, clustering centers and clustering lables for each segmented subsequence.

		Z --- the estimated subsequence segmentation

		C --- the estimated clustering centers

		L --- the clustering lable for each segmented subsequence
